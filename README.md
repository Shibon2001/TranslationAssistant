🤖**Jarvis Translator Assistant:-** A conversational AI-based voice translation assistant built with Python. Jarvis can greet you, translate text between multiple languages using Google Translator, and speak aloud both the original and translated text with realistic voice synthesis via pyttsx3.


**Features:-**

🔸 Voice-based interaction — Jarvis speaks to you using text-to-speech.

🔸 Automatic language detection — No need to specify the source language.

🔸Supports 100+ languages — Powered by deep-translator.

🔸Dynamic greetings — Responds appropriately based on time of day.

🔸Polite, continuous translation loop — Keeps translating until you say “no.”



**Technologies Used:-**

🔸Deep_translator-	     Handles text translation using Google Translate API.

🔸Pyttsx3-	             Converts text to speech (offline TTS engine).

🔸Datetime	             Provides time-based greetings.

🔸Time-	                 Used for pacing responses with natural pauses.
